		<h2>Section 1</h2>
		<p>After three years of taking courses I realized that I was not passionate about my major, which was Sonography. I felt that my major wasn’t exciting or challenging enough. So what was the point of having a career in something that I did not like? My uncle, who is an electrical engineer, stated that I should start taking computer classes, because it’s something different and I may like it..m.df.mdmf,m,f,.d,fmdmflkfdlkjfdlfjdjalfjdljfdklsjfljdlsjf lkjdjfljdljfdljfljkflkjd ljajldfjflj lkjfdljf;a jfljdljf lkdjfkldjkljjfkjjlfjdlkjfjfjfjffjjffjffjfjfjjfjfjfjfjfjfjjfjjjfjjjjjjjjfjfjfjjfjjjfjjfjfklj I decided to transfer to University Of Texas, to major in Computer Science, and ultimately in CyberSecurity. This major, is perfect for me because Cyber Security is always changing and I will be always learning. I chose to continue my education in the University of Texas, because it’s one of the best universities in the nation and it is in the city that I love. Another attractive aspect of this university is that, it offers many internships and gives undergraduates opportunities to participate in research. I would love to take advantage, and learn more about cybersecurity. Therefore, I decided to take his advice and enroll in my first computer class, which was Fundamentals of Networking, which led me into wanting to major in Information Technology. Fundamentals of Networking was fascinating and challenging enough to keep me interested in the class. The class was challenging, because it was one of the advanced class and I had no idea what the network even was, and how the computers interact with each other.  Another class that I found intriguing, was computer Forensics. This class was the most interesting and fun course that I have taken. In the classroom during the lab hours I had an opportunity to use a software called Encase to recover files from my hard drive. Before taking Computer Forensics, I didn’t know that a software will be able to retrieve any deleted files from the hard drive.

Therefore, I decided to watch several youtube videos about network security. I also downloaded security software such as Metasploit and BackTrack, and ran scripts from various sources, for the purpose of securing my home network. However, I had no idea what the script that I executed meant, I was just a newcomer, a person who would run a code that other programmers wrote, but doesn’t understand each line of code. I knew that I wanted to be more than just a script kiddie, I wanted to write my own script and understand each line of them. Not only that I wanted to write my own script, but I also wanted to understand other programmer’s codes and find the flaws within them and fix them, so that the system or software using the codes will be more secure.
